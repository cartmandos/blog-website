## Backpressure in Microservices

Backpressure is a technique used in microservices to handle overload situations. When a service is receiving more requests than it can handle, it can respond with backpressure to slow down the rate of incoming requests. In this article, we will discuss how to implement backpressure in microservices.

## 1. Use Queues

One way to implement backpressure is to use queues to buffer incoming requests. When a service is overloaded, it can push requests into a queue and process them at a slower rate. This allows the service to handle bursts of traffic without becoming overwhelmed.

## 2. Implement Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers are another technique for handling backpressure. When a service is under heavy load, it can open the circuit breaker and stop accepting new requests. This prevents the service from becoming overwhelmed and allows it to recover gracefully.
